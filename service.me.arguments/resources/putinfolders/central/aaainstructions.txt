This is the central folder for service.me.arguments.
Any text file that doesn't start 'aaa' will be read, copied, renamed and run.
Anything starting 'aaa' will be ignored.
Anything that isn't a text file will be ignored.

If the phrase 'nodelay' is in the file name it will be run immediately on being read.
If not the reading machine may add a delay before action.
This is to avoid eg simultaneous library updates.

When a file is processed it will be renamed and the name of the processing machine will be added.  
A timestamp will also be added, which will allow older files to be cleared.
